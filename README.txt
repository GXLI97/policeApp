Description
Front end app that displays data on police locations, heatmaps, and crime locations. It also sends GPS coordinates to the backend server. 

How to install:
Download Android Studio and open up the project from there. 

How to run:
Click the run button. You can run on either emulator or a device. However, not sure if you can connect to the localhost server from a usb debugged device.

Future Directions:
Develop the app in a cross platform technology such as React Native.
Collaborate more in detail with the police department on UX.
